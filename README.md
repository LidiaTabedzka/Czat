# Czat
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use Socket.io framework in my projects for the first time.

It is a simple live chat app created using React and Socket.io framework. The user can not only write a new message, but also edit it or delete it (all changes will be visible to all users at the same time).
